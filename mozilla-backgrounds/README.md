### For creating custom background for mozilla quantum new tab page.
1. Go to about:support in the address bar. View the section "Application Basics" ➔ Profile Directory (or "Profile Folder" on MacOS) ➔ click the button "Open Directory" (or "Show in Finder" on MacOS): 
<hr><br> 2. Create a directory called chrome inside the opened directory, if it's not already there.
<br>Go to the chrome directory and create a directory called img 
And in to chrome folder copy the userContent.css.
<br>Add the images you want as your firefox background to img folder
<br>  **(do not forgot to change the givenimage name to your image name.)
<hr><br> 3. Go to the url about:config, accept the risk (we will not really do anything harmful here, nothing to worry about), and in the Search Bar,
paste toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets, and set the value to true. This tells Firefox to load the CSS file at startup.

<br><i> feel free to change the code as you want it.<br>
 I used it beacuse the firefox no more allows users to change the wallpaper as chrome does , atleast no more );</i>
